# Tier 0 Baseline Data Collection

**Purpose:** Record 5-10 sessions **without Cortex** to establish baselines for cold start time, decision regression, and re-exploration.

**Period:** YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD
**Project:** [Description of project being worked on]

---

## Instructions

1. **Disable Cortex hooks** in Claude Code settings (remove or comment out the hooks JSON)
2. Perform real development work across 5-10 sessions
3. For each session, record the metrics below
4. Sessions should build on prior work to measure context loss

## Observations

### Common Context Loss Patterns

[What types of information were most often lost or re-explained?]

### Most Frustrating Scenarios

[Which situations caused the most friction due to lost context?]

### Files Most Frequently Re-Explored

[List files that were repeatedly re-read across sessions]

---

## Next Steps

After completing 5-10 baseline sessions:
1. Re-enable Cortex hooks in Claude Code settings
2. Proceed to Phase 4 (A/B Comparison)
3. Use the same project and comparable tasks for fair comparison
